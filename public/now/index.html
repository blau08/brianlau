    <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>

        <section class="now-update">
<h3>February 28 2026 <span class="location">— Tokyo, Japan</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Two months in:</strong> I have 1 month left. Time has flown by. What felt long at the beginning now feels short. </li>
    <li><strong>Housing reality:</strong> Still not ideal. Living on the 2nd floor means 6am motorcycles and 7am street sweeping. Annoying, but I’ve adapted. Humans are flexible if there’s sunlight and fresh air.</li>
    <li><strong>Language progress:</strong> I know about 90% hiragana/katakana now. Thankfully I can save time on Kanji. I'm happy I got a 100 on the listening/reading on Test 2. It shows improvement. I've surprised myself, I thought I was gonna fail every tests, but it seems if I keep up the improvement, I'll be able to pass the course. It wasn't easy putting in extra time after class. </li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Tokyo:</strong> Visited Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Yokohama, Akihabara, Odaiba, Ikebukuro, Makuhari Messe, Tokyo Skytree, Meguro, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (my favorite so far).</li>
    <li><strong>People & time:</strong> Made new friends (Nina, Dayeong), reconnected with Jeremy, Marina, Ryuto, and my cousin Eric. Classmates come and go quickly. Everyone is here for different lengths and different reasons — many because of anime — and it makes me think a lot about time and how temporary this season is.</li>
    <li><strong>People & time:</strong> Favorite food is Sukiya for breakfast, Shabu Shabu for tasty desserts, and Soba is surprisingly healthy. </li>
</ul>

        <h3>January 17 2026 <span class="location">— Tokyo, Japan</span></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One week in:</strong> I’m settling into Tokyo life and building a simple daily routine around Japanese study, walking, and exploring my neighborhood.</li>
            <li><strong>Language focus:</strong> I’m drilling basics (hiragana/katakana, survival phrases) and trying to practice speaking/listening in real situations—stores, trains, and everyday errands.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning the systems:</strong> Japan is amazing, but everything has rules—especially trash sorting and recycling. I’m slowly getting it right.</li>
            <li><strong>Weekend adventures:</strong> I’m starting to meet people and do group outings into the city center—food, sightseeing, and just experiencing Tokyo together.</li>
            <li><strong>Health & rhythm:</strong> Trying to stay consistent with movement (walks + light workouts) and eat better while I’m here.</li>
            <li><strong>Overall Feelings:</strong> While the program/housing is starting out rough, I’m optimistic about the next few months, just like I was in Tianjin.I've made a few friends, mostly American, but hope to get to know the rest of the class from Brazil, Kazakhstan, India, Korea, Taiwan, Russia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>January 6 2026 <span class="location">— Portland, Oregon</span></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Happy New Year:</strong> Today's my last day in Portland. I'll be spending 3 months in Tokyo Japan learning and resetting. </li>
            <li><strong>Anni's Vist Was Nice:</strong> We did a lot of Christmas stuff like going to Seattle, Canada, meeting with uncle/aunt, eating with family, meeting friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrapping Up:</strong> It was a good 4 months of Dota. The game is amazing. Patch 7.40 dropped during Christmas. Offlane is undesirable. I get reported when I play unconventional Position 5.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Good Morning:</strong> I've been back a month now. The weather is finally cooling down to the 60s, no more 80 degree weather. I've playing a lot of 
                basketball at Seth Lewelling Elementary through our nonprofit Founders Basketball. We've been playing 2 days a week and I've been swimming again at LA Fitness. 
                Every week, I hang out with Uncle Ernest for a walk to Clackamas High School track, coffee, or chess. </li>
            <li><strong>I've got a couple months:</strong> To figure out my plans for next year whether it be going back to China or Germany. Anything is possible!</li>
            <li><strong>Also started gaming again:</strong> with Kevin, Jimmy, and Super. We beat Cute Defense after 12 hours and got back into Dota with James and SC2 as well.</li>
        </ul>
