        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>When I was young, I loved to play and compete. I was lucky to grow up with 2 brothers and 5 cousins while our families ran a restaurant and later a grocery store. I loved to play basketball, play video games,
            play cops and robbers in the warehouse, and watch anime. I loved bringing people together and going on an adventure. I was too competitive. I couldn't take losing at anything with my brothers. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Life Philosophy:</h2>
        <p>I feel like my way of living is always changing. I've always felt the world is full of contradictions and it was difficult to accept it. Why must there be bad? Why must there be pain? It wasn't until college that 
            I had to learn all these things the hard way because I didn't like the idea of dogma (accepting others' beliefs), I had to experience it for myself.</p>
